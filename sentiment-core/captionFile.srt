00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Hello Kay, hello Ian, hello Pauline

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,260
Nice to see you, lovely smile by the way

3
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,420
Thank you

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,000
Radiant

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,600
What do you do, Pauline?

6
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:15,200
I look after the personnel within the planning and leisure departments of Dudley Council

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,360
- Oh, Dudley?
- Yes
- I love Dudley

8
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,320
Er, I used to worry about my health, you know?

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,400
But that was back when I had some

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,200
[LAUGHTER]

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,840
What other jobs have you done, Pauline, before you took up what you do?

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,600
I've worked as a clerical assistant for a firm of solicitors

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,600
I've worked in a shop

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,200
And I've worked at a holiday camp as a chalet maid

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,040
- Oh really?
- Yes
- Oh yeah! Any funny incidents on a holiday camp?

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:48,200
Yes, we had one particular day when I was setting off with my bucket and mop and bits and pieces

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,460
and a gorilla picked me up, threw me over his shoulders and ran `round the camp with me and all my truntlements

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,840
I remember you now

19
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:59,200
[LAUGHTER]

20
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,980
- Ian, you're a social worker, Sir?
- I am, yes

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,800
And what do you do in Wakefield?

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,000
I carry out community care assessments on adults with learning disabilities

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,120
Oh right! Er, how did you come to meet your wife?

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,040
Well, about thirty years ago

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,120
The day I started in social work

26
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,820
We shared a desk and a phone

27
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,540
And it was hate at first sight

28
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,660
[LAUGHTER]

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,860
Same with me and my first wife

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,980
I met her at a drunken orgy and I found her so annoying

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,640
For one thing she was supposed to be home taking care of the kids

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,440
[LAUGHTER]

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,160
If you...

34
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,480
If you were not a social worker, Ian, what would be your dream job?

35
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,280
I'd like to be a driver of a steam locomotive

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,120
- Oh you're a kiddy at heart?
- I am

37
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,080
- Never grown up?
- No

38
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,920
Actually I can understand that because when you were a kiddy

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,940
working for the railways was a very, very nice job

40
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,900
But there's no loyalty to old employees any more:

41
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,580
Three years as an engine driver and my cousin got sacked just because

42
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,380
he didn't slow down and stop at one station!

43
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
Admittedly: Euston

44
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,540
[LAUGHTER]

45
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,920
Kay? You sell stuff?

46
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,940
I sell stuff, yes, I sell metal boxes

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,040
- Little boxes?
- No, metal boxes
- Metal boxes, yes

48
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,400
What form do they take, little secure containers?

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,480
Some. Well, all sizes really from that size to wardrobes.

50
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,960
- Anything you can lock up?
- Yes
- Yeah

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,920
We make cabinets for electricity companies

52
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,400
- Ah, right, meters?
- Meter cabinets
- Hate meters

53
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,260
I've hated meters ever since I was a little boy because my dad painted ours red and told me it was my money box

54
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,060
[LAUGHTER]

55
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,000
Before you started making, selling tin boxes, metal boxes, (steel boxes?), what did you do?

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,660
- I worked for a wallpaper company
- Oh, yeah? Any funny customers?
- We had a few funny customers, yes:

57
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:59,140
One in particular rang up to complain that there were faces in her wallpaper which... [LAUGHTER]

58
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,020
What, lumpy ones? She was just getting visions was she?

59
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,240
She was having visions. We sent someone out to investigate.

60
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,240
I think people often see imaginary faces that aren't there, don't they?

61
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,840
In clouds, in coal fires...

62
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,400
The stalls of theatres where I'm appearing?

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,200
[LAUGHTER]

64
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,920
What about other jobs, Kay, what else have you done?

65
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:22,140
I've had several. I worked for a time-share company in the far north of Scotland for a short time.

66
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,140
Oh, really, far north? Oh yeah, I had a girlfriend up in the far north.

67
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,900
Well, she was very popular

68
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,900
She was the favourite of all the lads between the Orkneys and the Shetlands

69
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,160
In fact she was the original Fair Isle Pushover

70
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,960
[LAUGHTER]

71
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,060
And what about your partner's job, what does your...?

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,920
- He's an aspiring author
- Oh, really?
- Not published yet

73
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,780
- But he is writing
- He's hoping. He's writing.
- Money in mysteries writing..

74
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,140
Get him to write some mysteries because they sell, they really do

75
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,640
Do you know how many mystery writers it takes to change a light bulb?

76
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,340
Only one. But it needs a very clever twist at the end.

77
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,260
[LAUGHTER]

78
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,920
Would you please make my guests feel welcome, ladies and gentlemen?

79
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,720
Thank you
[APPLAUSE]

80
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,680
Ha Ha. Lovely.

81
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,700
Lovely story
